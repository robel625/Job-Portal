The product is built using a two-tier pattern where the React frontend is decoupled logically and physically from the API backend. To use the product, a short action list must be completed successfully:
-	Compile and start the Django API Backend
      -	by default the server starts on port 8000
-	Compile and start the React UI
      -	UI will start on port 3000 and expects a running backend on port 8000
-	Configuration (Optional)
      -	Change the API port
      -	Configure the API port used by the React UI to communicate with the backend
